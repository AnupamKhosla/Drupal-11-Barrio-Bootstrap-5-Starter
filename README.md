# Drupal 11 Barrio Bootstrap 5 Starter
A teaching-focused Drupal site that demonstrates how the **Barrio** theme integrates and implements **Bootstrap** in a real project.

This as an open-source **"Starter Kit"** for the Drupal community.

The goal is to create a complete **Reference Implementation** of the Bootstrap 5 Barrio theme. Unlike a blank theme installation, this project will come pre-configured with working examples of every Bootstrap component (Carousels, Tooltips, Modals, Accordions) implemented correctly using Drupal Blocks and Views.

It effectively functions as a **"Living Documentation"** — developers can clone it to see exactly how to implement complex Bootstrap features in Drupal 11 without guessing.

## Project Goals

* Teach how Barrio uses Bootstrap structure, utilities, and components
* Show practical theme layer patterns in Drupal 11
* Provide a clean reference implementation for learning and demos
* Keep the setup straightforward and reproducible

## Tech Stack

* Drupal 11
* Barrio base theme
* Bootstrap
* DDEV local environment
* Custom sub-theme of Barrio
